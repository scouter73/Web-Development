# Assignment 1

## Creating a basic webpage
For the first assignment you will need to create a basic webpage using the HTML we have covered in class so far. While the exact content of the page isn't specified you must demonstrate that you understand the topics we have covered so far. This will be a multipage website consisting of at least 2 pages. Each page should include a title for the browser tab. It does not matter where each of the required elements are as long as you include all of them. Use semantic elements to structure the elements on the page, you can find a list of several semantic elements [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

### Required elements
- A heading tag and a paragraph
- Each page should have an internal link to the other page(s)
- An external link (going somewhere else)
	- Ensure the external link behaves properly
- A page title
- At least one list. It can be unordered or ordered
- A table with a header and at least 3 rows of data
- An image

All of the numbers above are minimums, feel free to include more than that if you would like. Remember, don't just create a directory for your assignment. You'll need to clone your assignment repo first and then begin your work. If you need a refresher on git and GitHub classroom there is a document in D2L. When you're done, be sure to enable GitHub pages for the repo and submit the link to the quiz in D2L.
